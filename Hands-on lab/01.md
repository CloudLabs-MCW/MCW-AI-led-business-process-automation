## Exercise 1: Extract text and structure from documents with Forms Recognizer

Duration: 60 minutes

Azure Form Recognizer is a part of [Azure Applied AI Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/applied-ai-services/) that lets you build automated data processing software using machine learning technology. You can identify and extract text, key/value pairs, selection marks, tables, and structure from your documents. The service outputs structured data that includes the relationships in the original file, bounding boxes, confidence, and more. You can quickly get accurate results tailored to your specific content without heavy manual intervention or extensive data science expertise. Form Recognizer comprises custom document processing models, prebuilt models for invoices, receipts, IDs and business cards, and the layout model.

Contoso has its own document template for claims processing. In this exercise, you will be using a set of documents to train a custom model with labels. When you train with labeled data, the model uses supervised learning to extract values of interest, using the labeled forms you provide. In this case, Form Recognizer uses the [Layout API](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/concept-layout) to learn the expected sizes and positions of printed and handwritten text elements and extract values.

### Task 1: Prepare custom model to process documents

1. To access the training data in Azure Storage, we need a [SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/delegate-access-with-shared-access-signature) access link. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account Overview page by selecting **Resource groups** from Azure services list, selecting the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group, and selecting the **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account from the list of resources.

### Task 2: Configuring Azure Functions and Event Grid for document uploads

As part of its automation process, Contoso will upload claims documents in the form of PDF files to an Azure Storage account as blobs. An Azure Function App has to detect new files and process them with the trained Forms Recognizer Model. [Event Grid](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-grid/overview) is the perfect candidate to build applications with event-based architectures thanks to its built-in support for events coming from Azure services, like storage blobs and resource groups. For the Functions App to detect new blobs, you will be using an Azure Event Grid subscription and defining an event handler for the matching Azure Function.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account located in the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The storage account is highlighted.](media/select-storage-account.png "Storage Account Selection")

2. From the left menu, select **Events (1)**. Make sure you are on the **Get Started (2)** page. Select **Azure Function (3)** as the event destination type. Select **Create (4)** to continue.

   ![Storage account page is open. The events panel is shown. Azure Functions is selected. Create button is highlighted.](media/storage-event-function.png "Create Storage Event Subscription")

3. From the list of function apps, expand the function app named **contoso-func-SUFFIX** **(1)** to get a list of functions available. From the list, select the **ClaimsProcessing** **(2)** function.

   ![Function Apps are listed. Contoso function app functions are shown. ClaimsProcessing function is highlighted.](media/event-grid-select-claimsprocessing.png "Function Selection for Event Grid")

4. Select **Add Event Grid Subscription (1)**.

   ![ClaimsProcessing function is selected. Add Event Grid Subscription link is highlighted.](media/event-grid-add-subscription.png "Add Event Grid Subscription")

5. Set the values listed below:

    - **Name (1):** **DocumentEvents**
    - **Topic Type (2):** Storage account.
    - **Source Resource (3):** Contoso storage account.
    - **System Topic Name (4):** **DocumentEvent**
    - **Filter to Event Types (5):** Blob Created

   ![Create event subscription page is presented. The event name is set to DocumentEvents. Topic Type is set to Storage account. Source Resource is set to contosoSUFFIX storage account. System Topic Name is set to DocumentEvent. Blob Created and Blob Deleted events are selected. Create button is highlighted.](media/event-grid-create-subscription.png "Event Grid Subscription Settings")

    Select **Create (6)** to continue.

### Task 3: Implementing Forms Recognizer for document processing

To process documents, the Azure Function code has to find the latest model trained in the Forms Recognizer and use it to extract text and structure from a document at hand. In this task, you will be adding a couple of lines of code into an Azure Function App to find the model and use it for document processing.

1. Open **File Explorer** **(1)** and navigate to the `C:\MCW\MCW-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\source-azure-functions\Lab-DocumentProcessing` folder. Open **DocumentProcessing** **(2)** solution file. When asked, select **Visual Studio 2019** as the Visual Studio version to use.

    ![File Explorer shows the DocumentProcessing folder in C:\MCW\MCW-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\source-azure-functions\Lab-DocumentProcessing. DocumentProcessing solution file is highlighted.](media/visualstudio-open-documentprocessing.png "DocumentProcessing Solution")

2. In the Visual Studio sign in page select **Not now, maybe later.** to continue.

   ![Visual Studio Sign In dialog is presented. "Not now, maybe later" link is highlighted.](media/visualstudio-sign-in.png "Visual Studio Sign In")

3. On the Visual Studio Licensing page select **Sign-In** and use Microsoft Account credentials. This will register a Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition license for your account for free.

    ![Visual Studio License page is open. Sign-In button is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-license.png "Visual Studio License")

4. Once the solution is open, select the **ClaimsProcessing.cs (1)** file from the Solution Explorer. This file already has most of the plumbing implemented. Check out the section that gets the latest trained model from Forms Recognizer (2). The only missing piece is the code that runs the document through Forms Recognizer to get the key/value pairs and structure.

    ![DocumentProcessing solution is open. ClaimsProcessing.cs file content is shown. The code that gets the latest trained model from Forms Recognizer is highlighted. A Todo comment about coding the document processing with Forms Recognizer is highlighted.](media/DocumentProcessing-FormsRecognizer.png "DocumentProcessing Solution")

5. Copy and paste the code below to create a Client object to connect to Forms Recognizer. The endpoint and credential objects are already defined at the start of the ClaimsProcessing.cs code. **IncludeFieldElements** parameter will ensure that all lines per page and field elements such as lines, words, and selection marks for each form field are included.

    ```cs
    var formRecognizerClient = new FormRecognizerClient(new Uri(endpoint), credential);
    var options = new RecognizeCustomFormsOptions() { IncludeFieldElements = true };
    ```

6. Now that the **FormRecognizerClient** is ready, it is time to call **StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri** to start the actual recognition work. You are passing in the previously found ModelId, sasUri, a direct HTTP access link to the PDF file to be processed, and the options object we created in the previous step. Copy and paste the code below to continue your implementation.

    ```cs
    RecognizeCustomFormsOperation operation = formRecognizerClient.StartRecognizeCustomFormsFromUri(latestModel.ModelId, sasUri, options);
    ```

7. Once we start the process, we can either check its status or actively wait for completion. In our case, we will actively wait for the completion of the process by calling **WaitForCompletionAsync**. Once we got the response, we can access its value in the form of **RecognizedFormCollection**. Copy and paste the code below to complete the implementation.

    ```cs
    Azure.Response<RecognizedFormCollection> operationResponse = await operation.WaitForCompletionAsync();
    RecognizedFormCollection forms = operationResponse.Value;
    ```

8. Close Visual Studio. You don't have to worry about the changes you have implemented. A fully functional version of the Function App is already deployed to your Lab environment and will be soon ready to be tested.

### Task 4: Connecting CosmosDB and Forms Recognizer to Azure Functions

For the document processing automation, our Azure Function must read the documents from Azure Storage, connect to Azure Forms Recognizer and use the trained model, and finally connect to CosmosDB to save the final results. In this task, we will connect all the required services to the **ClaimsProcessing** function.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your **contosoSUFFIX** Storage Account located in the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.
