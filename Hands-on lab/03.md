## Exercise 3: Using Azure Cognitive Search to index and serve data

Duration: 45 minutes

Contoso has an internal web portal hosted in an Azure App Service where staff can access various content and forms. The organization is looking to enhance the portal by centralizing patient information, streamlining, unifying, and simplifying access to claims documents and audio recordings. In this exercise, you will be indexing claims and audio transcription data sets in a Cognitive Search service using indexers that connect to Cosmos DB. [Azure Cognitive Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) is a cloud search service that gives developers an architecture, APIs, and tools to build rich search experiences over private, heterogenous content in web, mobile, and enterprise applications. Finally, you will configure the web portal to use the indexes for a unified search experience enriched with health analytics metadata.

### Task 1: Setting up indexer for forms documents

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the **contoso-search-SUFFIX** Search service from the lab resource group.

### Task 3: Implementing Cognitive Search for a unified search experience

In this task, we will look into the implementation of Cognitive Search used to search data extracted from claims documents, patient audio recording transcriptions, and healthcare analytics.

1. Connect to your LABVM. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to the `C:\MCW\MCW-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\source-hospital-portal\contoso-web` folder. Open **contoso-web** solution file.

    ![File Explorer shows the DocumentProcessing folder in C:\MCW\MCW-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\source-hospital-portal\contoso-web. contoso-web solution file is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-open-contoso-web.png "contoso-web Solution")

2. Once the solution is open, select the **Index.cshtml.cs (1)** file from the Solution Explorer. Analyze the code that starts with the **Searching for Claims Document** comment.

   ![contoso-web solution is open in Visual Studio. Index.cshtml.cs is shown. Searching for Claims Document code is highlighted.](media/hospital-portal-claims-search.png "Searching for Claims Document Code")

3. Analyzing the first section of the code, you can see the **claimsSearchclient** created out of the service endpoint, index name, and credential that helps to access Azure Cognitive Search. The fields that we want to select are assigned to the **Select** collection of the **SearchOptions** object.

   ```cs
   SearchClient claimsSearchclient = new(new Uri(azureSearchUrl), claimsSearchIndexName, credential);
   SearchOptions claimsSearchOptions;
   SearchResults<Claim> claimsSearchResp
   claimsSearchOptions = new SearchOptions()
   {
      IncludeTotalCount = true,
      Filter = "",
      OrderBy = { "" }

   claimsSearchOptions.Select.Add("PatientName");
   claimsSearchOptions.Select.Add("InsuredID");
   claimsSearchOptions.Select.Add("PatientBirthDate");
   claimsSearchOptions.Select.Add("DocumentDate");
   claimsSearchOptions.Select.Add("Diagnosis");
   claimsSearchOptions.Select.Add("FileName");
   ```

4. In the following section, the **Search** method is used to send the query to the target index. The result can be iterated and passed to other objects, in this case, for data binding.

   ```cs
   claimsSearchResponse = claimsSearchclient.Search<Claim>(indexSearch, claimsSearchOptions);
   await foreach (SearchResult<Claim> result in claimsSearchResponse.GetResultsAsync())
   {
      Claims.Add(result.Document);
   }
   ```

5. Now, you can close Visual Studio. A fully functional version of the Web App that searches multiple indexes is already deployed to your Lab environment and will be soon ready to be tested.

### Task 4: Configuring the hospital portal

In this task, we will connect our Azure Cognitive Search indexes with the hospital portal and provide read access to the original documents so that the portal can show the actual files as well.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select the **contoso-search-SUFFIX** Search service from the lab resource group.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The search service is highlighted.](media/select-search-service.png "Search Service Selection")

2. On the **Overview (1)** page, copy the **Url (2)** for the service to a text editor of your choice to be used later in the lab.

   ![Overview page for the search service is open. URL Copy button is highlighted.](media/search-copy-endpoint.png "Endpoint URL for Azure Search")

3. From the left menu, select **Keys (1)** and copy the **Primary admin key (2)** to a text editor of your choice to be used later in the lab.

   ![Keys page for the search service is open. Copy button for the primary admin key is highlighted.](media/search-copy-key.png "Search Service Primary Admin Key")

4. Go back to your resource group and select **contoso-portal-SUFFIX** App Service. This is the App Service hosting the hospital portal.

   ![Lab resource group is open. The App Service for the hospital portal is highlighted.](media/select-app-service.png "App Service Selection")

5. From the left menu, select **Configuration (1)**, then select **New application setting (2)**.

   ![App Service Configuration page is open. New application setting link is highlighted.](media/app-service-new-application-setting-step.png "App Service New Application Setting")

6. Set **Name (1)** to **ContosoStorageConnectionString** and **Value (2)** to the previously copied Azure Storage Connection String. Select **OK (3)** to save.

   ![Add Edit Application setting panel is open. Name is set to ContosoStorageConnectionString. Value is set to the previously copied Contoso storage account connection string. OK button is highlighted.](media/app-setting-config-storage.png "App Service Storage Application Setting")

7. Repeat the same steps to add the **Application Settings** listed below.

   | Name           | Value                                                                 |
   |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | AzureSearchUrl | Previously copied Endpoint **URL** for Cognitive Search               |
   | AzureSearchKey | Previously copied Endpoint **Primary Admin Key** for Cognitive Search |

8. Once all settings **(1)** are set, select **Save (2)** and **Continue**.

    ![New application settings are highlighted. Save button is pointed.](media/app-service-settings-save-step.png "Save new application settings")

9. Go back to the **Overview (1)** page. Restart the web app **(2)** and select the **URL (3)** to navigate to the hospital portal. 

    ![Overview page for the App Service is shown. URL for the App Service is highlighted.](media/app-service-navigate-to-portal.png "Hospital Portal URL")

10. Search for **covid (1)** on the portal and observe results that include both claims documents and visit transcriptions. Feel free to use the filters **(4)** based on medical information extracted by Cognitive Text Analytics for Health.

    ![Hospital Portal is shown. The search box is filled with COVID. Claims document and transcription results are highlighted. Filtering options based on medical information are highlighted.](media/hospital-portal.png "Hospital Portal")

    In the screenshot above, on the left **(4)**, you can find a list of categories of medical information extracted by Cognitive Services Text Analytics for Healthcare. Currently, the category list is filtered based on your search. It shows you the number of documents per category where medical information is found in the matching categories in the entire search result set. 

    On the top of the search result, the first record is a claims form **(2)**. In this case, thanks to Forms Recognizer, the data in the actual form is digitized and used to present a unified search experience across both claims forms and audio transcriptions. If you select the PDF link in the search result, you can see the original file and notice the diagnosis field extracted as COVID. 

    The second item in the search result **(3)** is an audio transcription. All the green highlighted sections are medical information that Text Analytics for Health identified. These keywords and their primary categories are used for further investigation either by keyword search **(1)** or faceted filtering **(4)**. You can always click the play button in the result view to listen to the actual patient-doctor dialog. 

    In the case of Contoso, the hospital wanted to prioritize claims forms in the search result. Therefore, the implementation includes two search queries to the claims index and audio index and combines the top-scoring items based on the business rule within the portal.
